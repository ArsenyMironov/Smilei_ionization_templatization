# GPU validation test cases

CPU and GPU tests cases used to validate the basics of Smilei on GPU

## Usage

While waiting for validation.py to be able to look at a specific benchmark folder/validation script/reference, one could create link from `smilei/benchmarks/gpu` to `smilei/benchmarks`.

For instance:
```bash
$ ln -f -s $(pwd)/smilei/benchmarks/gpu/*.py smilei/benchmarks/
```
